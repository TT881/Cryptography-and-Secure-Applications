to Execute. 

2. For Decryption, Kindly use command --> javac LDESDecryption.java
                                   --> java LDESDescryption

3. For Verification, Kindly use command --> javac Verification.java

I had attached "Encryption_Program_Output.txt" & "Decryption_Program_Output.txt" , "Verification_Output.txt"  to Easily check the Program Output.
 
I also had attached a word file called "Task-3 Output" to produce the Output of 
Encryption & Decryption table , all the Results are based on the Program that 
I Build and Test.
