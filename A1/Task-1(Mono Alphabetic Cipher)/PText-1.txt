the same data structures in this case we treat each phase separately and
then determine how the decompositions and parallel algorithms developed
for each phase fit together the issues that arise in this situation are
discussed in chapter figure illustrates domain decomposition in a simple
problem involving a three dimensional grid  this grid could represent
the state of the atmosphere in a weather model or a three dimensional
space in an image processing problem computation is performed repeatedly
on each grid point decompositions in the x y and or z dimensions are
