possible in the early stages of a design we favor the most aggressive
decomposition possible which in this case defines one task for each grid
point each task maintains as its state the various values associated with
its grid point and is responsible for the computation required to update
that state functional decomposition also has an important role to play
as a program structuring technique a functional decomposition that
partitions not only the computation that is to be performed but also the
code that performs that computation is likely to reduce the complexity of
