To Run the Program, 
-> javac fast.java
-> java fast 

1. Ask user to Enter a, b , p .
base - a
Exponent - b
Modulus - p

Note: Exponent b value should be greater than 256. If not, Please enter b value again. 

2. Convert Exponent b into binary form 
Convert the binary into S SX form 
( If binary 1 --> Convert SX) 
( If binary 0  --> Convert S) 

3. Drop the first SX
4. Compute according to the S SX Sequence from Step-3
5. Display the final result. 

I've also attached the T2SampleOutput.txt file as Sample Output.
